"""OpenCode and Pi, the two harnesses with no package format to target.

Neither has an install command, a version, or an update path for a plugin, so
what they get is a tree of loose files that a person copies into a
configuration directory by hand. That is a real difference from a package and
the plugin's own README has to say so rather than claim support. Nothing here
writes a manifest, and the version number survives only in `foundry.lock.json`
and in the release asset name.

Both folders are the neutral tree with the unreadable kinds already taken out,
because the neutral directory names are the names both harnesses read. Copy an
OpenCode folder's contents into `.opencode/` and copy a Pi folder's contents
into `.pi/`, and every file lands where that harness looks for it.

    opencode                        pi
      skills/<name>/SKILL.md          skills/<name>/SKILL.md
      agents/<name>.md                prompts/<name>.md
      foundry.lock.json               foundry.lock.json

The one translation is Pi's. Pi calls a user-invocable prompt unit a prompt
template, loads it from `prompts/*.md`, and reads `argument-hint` where the
neutral form writes `arguments`. So `commands/` is rewritten into `prompts/`
and the neutral directory is removed, because a folder that holds a directory
its harness never reads ships a file the record cannot explain.

Four capabilities here disagree with the design document, the first three with
its section 2 folder listings and the fourth with its section 3 loss table, and
each disagreement was settled against that harness's own documentation:

  OpenCode reads MCP servers from an `mcp` block inside the user's own
  `opencode.json`, whose shape is not the `mcpServers` shape in the neutral
  `mcp.json`. No file a shipped folder can carry reaches it, so copying
  `mcp.json` in would put a file in the folder that nothing reads.

  Pi has no agent surface. Its packages carry skills, prompt templates, themes
  and extensions, and an extension is a TypeScript module rather than anything
  Foundry can generate from a markdown agent.

  Pi calls its command surface prompt templates and reads `prompts/`, not
  `commands/`, so shipping the neutral directory name would put every command
  somewhere Pi never looks.

  Pi carries `allowed-tools`, where the design drops it on every target except
  Claude Code. Pi's own skill documentation lists the field in the SKILL.md
  frontmatter it accepts, as a space-delimited list of pre-approved tools,
  marked experimental. So the design's reason for dropping it, that Pi does not
  state it enforces the field and shipping one would read as a boundary that is
  not there, is untrue twice over: Pi documents reading it, and pre-approval
  widens what a skill may do rather than fencing it, so removing the field
  narrows the skill instead of removing a false boundary.

Skills are the one kind both harnesses carry, and the two do not agree on what
counts as one. OpenCode reads `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and nothing else, while
Pi reads that and also discovers a loose `.md` file sitting directly beside
those directories, so a folder holding a loose file exposes a skill on Pi and
nothing on OpenCode. That is the difference-by-harness the whole design exists
to make impossible, and the build-wide depth check cannot catch it because it
looks for `SKILL.md` files and a shape holding none produces nothing to look
at, so a stray shape under `skills/` is refused here for both harnesses.

OpenCode does publish a command format of its own, which the design document
says it does not. It is left uncarried anyway: OpenCode's own documentation
calls the `template` frontmatter key required on one line and says the markdown
body becomes the template on the next, and emitting a file that a harness might
reject is worse than declaring the gap and printing it. That gap is stated as
Foundry not emitting the format rather than as OpenCode not having one, because
an error message that says something untrue about a harness is a bug in the
same way a silent drop is.

Every capability below was read from documentation rather than from loader
source. Foundry's rule is that code beats prose, so read the loaders before
this ships and expect at least the OpenCode command line to move.

    Skills are the one kind both harnesses carry, so this is the one place a
    stray shape reaches both, and the two harnesses do not answer it the same
    way. A loose `skills/<name>.md` is discovered on Pi and invisible on
    OpenCode, which means one built folder holding one file would expose two
    different skill lists and nothing anywhere would say so. That is exactly the
    failure the one-level rule exists to foreclose, and a drop cannot express it
    because the folder is not diminished on Pi at all.

    The build-wide depth check does not reach this. It globs for `SKILL.md` and
    reports one nested too deep, so a directory holding no `SKILL.md` anywhere
    produces no match and passes, and a loose markdown file is not a match to
    begin with. What is checked there is where a skill file sits; what is
    checked here is whether a thing is a skill at all.

    `lands` is the whole sentence naming what that harness does with a stray
    shape. It is a parameter rather than one shared line because the two
