"""One plugin, one staged tree, one folder per harness the author asked for.

The seam is after the staged tree is complete and before any lock file is
written. Everything to the left of it is the build tool that already existed:
resolution, fingerprinting, collisions, the `provides` check. Everything to the
right is a per-harness folder, and this package is the whole of it.

Adding a harness means adding one module beside this file and one line to
REGISTRY. Nothing else in Foundry changes, and that is the test of whether the
seam is in the right place.

What this file owns, and what no emitter may re-implement:

  the registry        which module emits which harness
  the loss policy     refuse, or record a pre-authorised drop, and nothing else
  pruning             taking out every kind the harness cannot represent
  the skill depth     one level under skills/, on every harness, always

The loss policy has exactly two outcomes. A declared kind a harness cannot
represent stops the build, naming the kind, the harness and the manifest line,
and both ways forward. Or the author already wrote that loss down under
`degrade.<target>.drop`, and it is printed and written into that harness's lock
file. There is no third outcome and Foundry never decides by itself, which is
the same rule as the build never picking a winner between two dependencies.
