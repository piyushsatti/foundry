"""The portable Agent Plugins 1.0.0 package, and the Codex folder built on it.

Agent Plugins 1.0.0 was published on 2026-07-27, the day the commit publishing
the specification reached `main` in the specification repository. That
repository carries no tags and no releases, so reaching `main` is the only
publication event there is. Its steering committee is the five people
`MAINTAINERS.md` names, from Amazon, Cursor, Microsoft, OpenAI and Vercel. It is
the one package shape more than one vendor agreed to, so Foundry adopts it
rather than inventing a neutral form of its own.

It standardises exactly two component types, skills and MCP servers. Its own
text says commands, hooks, agents, rules and LSP servers remain too
client-specific for a stable portable contract and are outside version 1, so
the portable folder carries none of them and the loss has to be written down.

    plugin.json                     root, not inside a dot directory
    mcp.json                        root, the path the specification names
    skills/<name>/SKILL.md          immediate children only
    foundry.lock.json

Codex is here rather than in a module of its own because it is a client of the
same package: the published compatible-client list gives it skills and MCP over
the stdio and streamable-http transports. It adds one file and takes one
transport away, and both are recorded below.

Everything this module writes was checked against the published schema and the
specification text rather than against the design document, because the
manifest is closed and a client that reads it rejects the whole plugin on any
violation other than an unknown top-level field. Three places where the design
document and the primary sources disagree, all resolved in favour of the
sources:

  author        The schema types `author` as an object with optional name,
                email and url, and the specification says any other field or
                value type makes the manifest invalid. The design document
                shows a plain string. A string is refused here rather than
                wrapped, because guessing which of the three fields the author
                meant is Foundry deciding, and the build never decides.

  repository    The schema carries it and `METADATA_KEYS` in `resolve.py` does
                not, so no manifest can set it and this emitter never writes
                it. Nothing is invented to fill it.

  mcp.json      The specification requires `$schema` and `mcpServers` and
                nothing else at the top level, and requires a `type` on every
                server. The design document's example has neither. A file
                missing `$schema` does not fail loudly: the client disables MCP
                for the whole plugin and carries on, which is the silent
                failure Foundry exists to catch, so it is refused.

Codex differs from the portable package in exactly two ways.

The first is a second manifest. Codex 0.139.0, read from its own binary,
requires `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and knows nothing of Agent Plugins: the
string `agent-plugins.org` does not appear in it anywhere. So the two manifests
are not a current file and a legacy one, they are the two sides of the release
where Codex adopted the standard, and a folder carrying only one of them is
unreadable on the other side. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` holds the same fields
without `$schema`, all of which that Codex accepts, and it also names where the
components are. The root manifest is a closed object with nowhere to put a
path, and the Codex that reads the overlay reads nothing else: both of its
component path fields are optional and default to nothing, so a component the
overlay does not point at is one that Codex never looks for. Without the
`mcpServers` line the plugin installs, reports success, and starts no server,
which is the failure this whole module exists to catch. The overlay does not
hold the `interface` block that OpenAI's curated marketplace ingestion asks
for, because a display name, a category and a default prompt are content
Foundry does not have and will not make up.

The second is the `sse` transport. The portable schema permits all three
transports and the compatible-client list gives Codex only stdio and
streamable-http, so an `sse` server reaches a Codex user as a server that is
silently skipped. That is refused here rather than dropped, because it is not
the kind that cannot be carried but one server inside a file that can.

What this folder does not carry, and why it is narrower than the design
document's Codex layout: agents, commands and hooks. The alpha ships hooks on
Claude Code only, Codex's own plugin manifest names no agent or command
location, and no per-harness hook event mapping has been read from source for
any harness. Writing the neutral `hooks/hooks.yaml` into a Codex folder would
leave a file there that nothing reads, and translating it into invented event
names would ship a guard that does not guard. Both are worse than a recorded
drop, so all three are declared as losses and the manifest has to name them.
