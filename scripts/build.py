"""Turn a plugin repository into one self-contained folder that can be shipped.

Runs inside a plugin repository, in that repository's own CI, once per release.
The folder it writes is complete: everything the plugin needs is already inside
it. A user downloads that folder and it works. Nothing is resolved, fetched or
assembled on a user's machine, and so nothing can conflict there.

What it does, in order:

  1. Ask resolve.py what this plugin needs and which Foundry version applies.
  2. Copy the plugin's own content into one neutral tree.
  3. Copy in the exact pieces it asked for from each dependency.
  4. Check every claim in `provides`, and that no skill is nested too deep.
  5. Decide, for each harness named in `targets`, what it cannot carry.
  6. Write one folder per harness, each with its own lock file.

Steps 1 to 4 know nothing about any harness. Step 6 is `scripts/emitters/`, one
module per harness, and no other part of this file knows what a harness is.

All of that happens in a scratch folder beside the destination, which is moved
into place only once the build finished. A refused build leaves nothing behind,
so running it again after fixing the cause works.

It refuses to guess. Two dependencies handing over a skill of the same name is
a collision with no correct answer, so it stops and names both. A plugin that
claims to provide something it does not have is a lie in the metadata, so it
stops and says which claim is empty. A kind that a named harness cannot carry
stops the build unless the manifest already wrote that loss down.

Operate:
    python3 build.py [PLUGIN_DIR] --out DIR
    python3 build.py [PLUGIN_DIR] --check     # build to a temp dir, discard it

Exit 0 when the folder is written, 1 on anything unresolvable.
