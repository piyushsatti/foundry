"""What each harness's folder has to hold, stated independently of the emitters.

This table says the same thing `scripts/emitters/` says, on purpose, and that
duplication is the only reason it is worth having. A check that asked the
emitters what they write and then confirmed they wrote it would agree with
every change, including a wrong one. So nothing in this directory imports
anything from `scripts/`, and nobody should tidy it into doing so.

Every row was read from the design and the primary sources behind it rather
than from the emitter that satisfies it:

| Harness | Manifest | Read from |
|---|---|---|
| agent-plugins | `plugin.json` at the package root | the published 1.0.0 schema, whose manifest is at the root and not inside a dot directory |
| claude-code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | what Foundry has always written, and the one path that must never move. Its MCP servers and hooks are read from `.mcp.json` and `hooks/hooks.json` (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference) |
| codex | both of the above shapes, root plus `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Codex 0.139.0 reads its own overlay, and a Codex that adopted the standard reads the root |
| instructions | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` | three harnesses read three names, and two of them read an `@file` import |
| opencode | none of any kind | OpenCode has no package format, no install command and no version |
| pi | none of any kind | Pi has no package format either, and the shape of a `pi` key inside `package.json` was never read from loader source |

The `never` column is the rule that no harness folder may hold a file that
harness does not read. An unread file sits inside the folder's `contents`
fingerprint with nothing to explain why it is there, which is the same failure
as the author's local settings reaching people who installed a plugin.

Two harnesses claiming the same path with different contents is why the outputs
are separate folders at all, so every folder is also checked for the manifests
that belong to the other harnesses. That check is derived rather than typed out,
because typing it four times is four chances to leave one out.
