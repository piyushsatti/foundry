"""The folders a build wrote are folders each harness can actually install.

Building is not the proof. A build that writes six folders and puts the Codex
manifest in the OpenCode one exits 0, prints six fingerprints and looks exactly
like a good build, because every failure this design is about is a file in the
wrong place rather than an error anybody raised. So the folders get opened.

What is checked, and why each one costs a release if it is wrong:

| Check | What it costs |
|---|---|
| one folder per name in `targets`, and no others | a harness somebody was promised ships nothing, or a folder ships that nobody asked for |
| the manifest each harness reads, at the path it reads it from | the plugin installs nowhere, or installs and is invisible |
| no other harness's manifest in the folder | two schemas claim one filename, which is the whole reason these are separate folders |
| nothing the harness cannot read | an unread file inside the folder's fingerprint that the record cannot explain |
| every skill exactly one level under skills/ | the same package exposes different skills on different harnesses, with no error anywhere |
| the lock file, parsing, naming its own harness | the folder cannot say what it is or what it was built from |
| nothing named in `exclude`, and no manifest, .git, .github or .claude | development material reaching people who installed a plugin |
| the release record agreeing with every lock file | the one place a person compares folders is a fabrication |

The expected shapes live in `harnesses.py` and are written from the design
rather than read from `scripts/emitters/`, which is what makes this a check
instead of an echo.
