# HATS.md — the hat-file authoring contract

A hat file defines one professional review lens. It is consumed by `consult`,
`hats`, and `red-vs-blue`, which compose its **body** with their own stance rules.
This file is the contract every hat must satisfy.

A hat is a **checklist-and-contract document with a thin domain header — not a
character.** "Be thorough", "think like an expert", "world-class architect" are
worthless: identity personas alone buy no accuracy and often *hurt*, and
identical-in-effect lenses add literally zero over a single reviewer
([D12], [D3] in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/adversarial-review-methodology.md` — if
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is unset, it sits at `../../../docs/adversarial-review-methodology.md`
relative to this file).
A hat earns its place by the failure classes it is responsible for and the
binary-checkable questions it always asks — not by who it claims to be.

## Frontmatter (registry metadata — NOT sent to the model)

```yaml
name: <hat-name>
status: v1
overlaps:
  - <other-hat>: "one-line boundary — where this hat ends and that one begins"
  - <other-hat>: "..."
```

- **`name`** — the roster key.
- **`status`** — `v1` after this pass; bump when a rubric or failure class is revised.
- **`overlaps`** — each near-neighbour hat plus the one-line boundary between them.
  This field is **registry metadata for the panel composer and the overlap eval
  only. Consumers MUST exclude the frontmatter from the dispatch prompt** — every
  non-task word in the payload is measured downside, and overlaps naming *other*
  hats is exactly that irrelevant detail [D16, D13]. The panel composer reads it to
  decide which hat pairs to run the distinctness test on; the reviewing model never
  sees it.

## Required body sections (in this order)

1. **`## Role`** — ONE sentence, task-coupled, demographically unmarked. Form:
   *"You are a [domain] reviewer. You review [artifact type] for [failure family]
   and always [core procedure]."* The domain header is the cheapest, weakest
   ingredient — worth one sentence, never more [D12].
2. **`## Failure classes`** — an enumerated list of defect classes this hat is
   **responsible** for catching, each with a one-line operational definition. These
   are responsibilities, **not** "uniquely caught": uniqueness is an empirical claim
   measured by the overlap eval, never asserted at authoring time [D16].
3. **`## Always ask`** — 3–6 questions, **each answerable yes/no/n-a against the
   artifact**. No open-ended "consider the architecture" prompts — binary-checkable
   items are what lift evaluator agreement; open ones forfeit the gain [D15].
4. **`## Evidence demands`** — what a finding from this lens must cite: a **location
   (file/section/step) plus a verbatim quote** from the artifact, before the finding
   is valid. A finding with no quoted evidence is **capped at the lowest severity
   band (nit)** [D15].
5. **`## Blind spots`** — the failure families this hat does **not** cover, each with
   which hat owns them. Keep terse — this section is also payload exposure [D13].
6. **`## Severity anchors`** — 1–2 hat-specific exemplar findings per severity level,
   so the shared taxonomy below has concrete anchors for this lens (e.g.
   "unauthenticated SQL injection on a reachable path = blocker") [D15].

Target ≤60 lines. Concrete, not aspirational.

## Shared severity taxonomy (lives here; every hat and consumer uses it)

Four levels, each a decision rule with binary-checkable conditions [D15]:

| Severity | Decision rule (binary-checkable) |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **blocker** | Ships incorrect behavior, data loss, or a security breach on a reachable path — and the evidence is quoted. |
| **major** | Violates a stated requirement or load-bearing decision, but a workaround or non-default path exists. |
| **minor** | A real defect with bounded impact that does not block the artifact's stated goal. |
| **nit** | Correctness-neutral improvement (clarity, consistency, style). |

**Evidence gate [D15]:** severity is assigned **only after** the evidence field is
filled with a verbatim quote + location. A finding lacking quoted evidence is
mechanically **capped at `nit`** regardless of how bad it sounds. Per-hat
`Severity anchors` specialize this table with concrete examples; they never
redefine the levels.

## Anti-flavor rule [D13]

Ban from every hat file: names, backstories, demographics (gender, age, race,
seniority-years), and "world-class / distinguished / 10x" intensifiers. This is not
style preference — irrelevant persona detail is **measured harm up to ~30pp**, and
demographic markers bias reasoning in the wrong direction. Every non-task-relevant
word is downside exposure, not neutral filler. The only identity a hat gets is its
one-sentence `Role`.

## Minting rule [D16]

> A new hat must declare at least one failure class **no existing hat lists.**
> If it cannot, it is a duplicate — **extend an existing hat instead.**

The declaration is the authoring bar; the *guarantee* of distinctness is not
asserted — it is **verified by the overlap eval** (run two-plus hats on one
artifact, compare finding-overlap against their declarations, and require each hat
to beat a no-persona control on its own classes). Before adding a hat, read the
roster in [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md), open the two or three nearest hats, and
confirm the new lens owns a failure class none of them do.

**Running the evals.** The overlap/distinctness eval is a runnable workflow, not
just a principle: `scripts/workflows/hat-evals.js` (from the repo root) fans the
hats + a no-persona control across a shared multi-lens fixture and reports, per
hat, in-class vs out-of-class findings, pairwise overlap, and the beats-control
verdict. The seeded-defect recall + model×effort side lives in
`scripts/workflows/role-benchmark.js` against the corpus at
`research/crucible/benchmark-2026-07/`. After editing a hat, re-run hat-evals and
diff against the last stored result in `research/crucible/hat-evals/` — a gain on
the edited lens does not clear the change; lane discipline and beats-control must
still hold [D16].

## Versioning note [D15]

Rubrics and failure-class definitions are **expected to be revised after real
review batches** — "grading outputs helps users define criteria" (Shankar et al.,
UIST 2024). A locked-forever rubric contradicts the best evidence. Bump `status`
and re-run the hat evals when definitions change; do not treat v1 as final.

## Composition note (for consumers, not authors)

The hat supplies *what to look at* (its body). The consumer supplies *how to engage*:
- **consult** → partner stance (brainstorm/validate, conversational).
- **hats** → neutral stance (raise-don't-fix, blind, reasoning-first findings contract).
- **red-vs-blue** → attack stance (red) and verify stance (blue), same hat both.

Never bake a stance into a hat file — that would break sharing. And never feed the
frontmatter to the model — body only [D16, D13].
